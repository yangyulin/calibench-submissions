# calibench-submissions

Submission intake + **re-run-eval CI** for the [Calibench](https://huggingface.co/calibench-vi)
calibration benchmark leaderboard.

Contributors submit calibration **outputs** (not scores) via a Pull Request. CI
validates the submission, **re-runs the Calibench evaluation** to compute the
metrics, and on merge publishes a verified row to
[`calibench-vi/results`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/calibench-vi/results) —
which the [leaderboard Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/calibench-vi/leaderboard)
renders.

- **Simulation** submissions are scored vs **private held-out ground truth**.
- **Real** submissions get GT-free metrics (reprojection / IMU residual / cross-tool).
- Scores are **recomputed here**, so they can't be self-reported away.

See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** to submit. Schemas are in
[`schemas/`](./schemas); a worked example is in [`submissions/EXAMPLE/`](./submissions/EXAMPLE).

## Status
Scaffold. `scripts/evaluate.py`'s metric computation (calling the CamCalib
evaluation harness + the private GT store) is the remaining **M3** wiring — until
then submissions publish as `self_reported`, clearly labeled on the leaderboard.

## Repo secrets (Settings → Secrets → Actions)
- **`HF_TOKEN`** — a Hugging Face token with **write** access to the `calibench-vi`
  org (used by `publish.py` to push verified rows to `calibench-vi/results`).
- *(later, M3)* a secret/source for the **held-out simulation GT** used to score `split: simulation`.
